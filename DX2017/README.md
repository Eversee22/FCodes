## "Introduction to 3D Game Programming with Directx 11" book codes modified with windows-sdk
All the codes were complied successfully in both debug and release (x86) modes on visual studio 2017 except the *Chapter 22 Ambient Occlusion/AmbientOcclusion*, which cannot run in debug mode while release mode do. If nothing unexpected would happen, all codes can be built and run directly without any modification except unzipping the texture files firstly.
